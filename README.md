# VirtualPets
This repository is a game where users can make an account, buy animals, feed animals, and do many more tasks.

In this game, users can:
- Make an account
- Update their account
- Buy an animal as a pet
- Name their new pet
- Change the name of their pet
- See a list of all the pets they have bought
- Buy food for their pets
- Create new food
- Feed their pets
- Do services for their pet

When a user first opens the game, they will have to create an account or else they cannot access the animal adoption agency or the food store.

Once the user creates an account, they start out with $650, with which they can use to buy an animal and/or food

When a user tries to buy an animal or a food, they can only buy it if they have enough money, and once they buy the item, they will lose money accordingly.

Users can feed animals and depending on what food they feed their animals, they can gain or lose money.
If users feed meat to animals that are carnivores, feed plants to animals that are herbivores, or they feed dessert to their animals, they can gain money,
otherwise they will lose money.

When a user feeds a food to an animal, that food gets deleted from their pantry.

Users can also gain money by taking care of their pet, by taking them on a walk and such.
